# Legacy code dump

Kitchen sink of mostly bioinformatics code and related resources that I wrote
over the years ...before starting to take coding more seriously ;)

May contain work of colleagues as well (typically marked as such inside the
files or by initials on the filenames).

Feel free to use, but no guarantees for anything!
